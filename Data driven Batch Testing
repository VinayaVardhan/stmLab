Concept Summary: Data-Driven Batch in WinRunner
What is it?
Data-driven batch testing is a way to run the same test script multiple times, each time with a different set of input data, all in a single execution loop. Instead of recording multiple test cases, you reuse a single test script and feed it various data sets through a data table.

💡 Why Use Data-Driven Batch Testing?
Saves time – avoids writing separate test cases for each input.

Improves test coverage with multiple input combinations.

Makes tests easier to maintain (just update the data table).

Helps identify bugs with both valid and invalid data sets.

🔁 Process Overview:
🔹 For Non-Data-Driven Testing:
Create test

Run test

Analyze results

🔹 For Data-Driven Batch Testing:
Create test

Convert test to data-driven test (replace hardcoded values with parameters)

Create data table (stores sets of inputs)

Run test

Analyze results

🛠️ How It Works in WinRunner:
Use the DataDriver Wizard or manual scripting.

Replace hardcoded inputs with parameters.

Link parameters to values in an external data table (e.g., Excel or .dat file).

Run test in a loop — each iteration pulls new data from the table.

📘 Example Scenario:
You want to test login functionality for 10 users.
Rather than writing 10 separate tests:

You write 1 test that reads username and password from a data table.

The test runs 10 times automatically with each set of credentials.

🎤 Viva Questions and Answers
Q1. What is data-driven batch testing?
A: It is a technique to run the same test multiple times with different sets of input data stored in an external data table.

Q2. Why is batch testing useful?
A: It saves time, improves test coverage, and avoids redundant test scripts.

Q3. What is the difference between normal testing and data-driven testing?
A: Normal testing uses fixed inputs; data-driven testing uses parameters linked to external data sources, allowing multiple input sets to be tested in one script.

Q4. What tool in WinRunner helps with data-driven testing?
A: The DataDriver Wizard.

Q5. What must be done to convert a regular test into a data-driven test?
A: Replace fixed values with parameters and create a linked data table containing the variable inputs.

Q6. What is stored in the data table?
A: Different sets of input values (e.g., usernames, passwords, product IDs, etc.) for each test iteration.

Q7. How does the test access each data row?
A: Through a loop that reads each row one by one and substitutes the parameters in the test with those values.

Q8. Is it necessary to create multiple scripts in batch testing?
A: No, only one reusable script is created; the data changes for each run.
