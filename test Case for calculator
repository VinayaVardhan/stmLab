âœ… Tips for Viva:
Q1. What are the types of test cases you wrote for the calculator?
A: Operational (UI-based) and functional (mathematical) test cases.

Q2. How do you test copy-paste functionality?
A: By copying a number from the calculator and pasting it into Notepad or any text field.

Q3. What should happen when dividing a number by 0?
A: It should either display an error message or "âˆž" depending on the calculator logic.

Q4. What is tested using the BODMAS test case?
A: It checks if the calculator follows operator precedence rules properly.
