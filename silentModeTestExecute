Silent Mode Test Execution in WinRunner
Definition:
Silent Mode is used to execute test scripts without any interruptions or pop-ups, ensuring a smooth, unattended execution process. It is particularly useful during batch test runs or overnight executions.

✅ Purpose of Silent Mode:
To avoid manual intervention during test runs.

To allow test execution to continue even if there are errors or pop-up dialogs.

To enable batch mode execution for multiple test cases.

⚙️ How to Enable Silent Mode in WinRunner:
Open WinRunner.

Click on the Tools menu.

Choose General Options.

Go to the Run Tab.

Select the checkbox "Run in batch mode" (this enables Silent Mode).

Click OK to apply the setting.

📌 This setting tells WinRunner to execute tests silently, without displaying any messages or dialogs.

📌 Important Notes:
When in Silent Mode, interactive functions like pause(), tl_step("message", ...), or msg_box() will not work as expected. These require user input or display messages, which are suppressed in silent execution.

Best suited for automated test environments like CI/CD pipelines or nightly builds.

🧠 Use Case Example:
Let’s say you have a test suite that runs every night. You don’t want the execution to stop because of a pop-up or a pause() function. By enabling Silent Mode, WinRunner will:

Skip any dialogs.

Continue running the remaining scripts.

Log the results in the report for review the next day.
