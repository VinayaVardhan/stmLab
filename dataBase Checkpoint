Concept Summary: Database Checkpoint ‚Äì Custom Check
What it is:
A Database Checkpoint (Custom Check) allows you to verify the contents of a database during automated testing. You can check specific rows, columns, and values from a result set returned by a query.

Why use it:
To ensure the data in the database is correct and consistent with what your application displays or uses.

Key things you can do:

Check specific rows and columns in the result set.

Compare actual vs expected data.

Count rows or columns returned by the query.

Edit the expected values manually if needed.

Tools supported:

ODBC

Microsoft Query

Data Junction

üìù Steps to Create a Custom Checkpoint
Go to Insert > Database Checkpoint > Custom Check.

If recording in Analog mode, press the CHECK DATABASE (CUSTOM) softkey.

Use the Database Checkpoint Wizard to set up the check.

Define or create a query using SQL or through tools like Microsoft Query.

If needed, parameterize the SQL query.

WinRunner captures the query and opens the Check Database dialog box.

üé§ Viva Questions and Answers
Q1. What is a database checkpoint?
A: A database checkpoint is used in automated testing tools like WinRunner to validate data retrieved from a database during test execution.

Q2. What is a custom check in a database checkpoint?
A: A custom check allows the tester to specify which properties (such as specific rows or columns) should be verified in the database result set.

Q3. What are the key purposes of a custom check?
A: To validate data content, edit expected results, and count rows or columns returned by a database query.

Q4. What are the tools you can use to perform a custom check?
A: ODBC, Microsoft Query, and Data Junction.

Q5. How do you parameterize an SQL query in a database checkpoint?
A: In the last screen of the Microsoft Query wizard, click ‚ÄúView data or edit query in Microsoft Query‚Äù, and then follow instructions to add parameters.

Q6. What is the difference between standard and custom database checkpoints?
A: Standard checkpoints check the entire result set automatically, while custom checkpoints allow the tester to manually specify and control what parts of the data to check.

Q7. Can we perform a database checkpoint in Analog mode?
A: Yes, by pressing the CHECK DATABASE (CUSTOM) softkey during recording.

Q8. What happens after defining the SQL query?
A: WinRunner captures the query and opens the Check Database dialog box where further configurations or validations can be made.
